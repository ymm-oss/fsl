# Optimistic merge and post-merge product validation

Status: Accepted

## Decision

Pull requests into `main` run the **complete Linux evidence** — `merge readiness` as a
short-latency fail-fast lane, plus `rust workspace` and `WASM`. Only the **cross-platform matrix**,
`native Z3 4.16` on macOS and Windows, is deferred to after the merge, together with the aggregate
`product gate` context; that matrix also runs on schedule, on manual dispatch, and before promotion
to `production`.

This changes `main` from "every supported platform was green before merge" to "every change was
fully tested on Linux before merge, and the remaining platforms are validated immediately after."
A post-merge failure can therefore still expose a temporarily broken `main`, but only for a
platform-specific defect. The failed check and its deduplicated issue are blocking evidence for
production/release promotion and must be repaired or reverted; they are not informational warnings.

### Why the split falls here

Measured on the batch that motivated this revision:

- **The tests live in the crates the bounded lane excludes.** 103 of 124 integration test files sit
  in `fslc` (77), `fsl-tools` (16), `fsl-verifier` (8) and `fsl-lsp` (2). `merge readiness` runs 21.
- **Its compile lane does not build test targets at all** — `cargo check` without `--all-targets` —
  so a type error or a failing assertion in any of those 103 files reached `main` and surfaced only
  post-merge. Only `cargo fmt --check` covered them, and only for syntactic breakage. Adding
  `--all-targets` there was tried and **reverted**: measured at 12m42s in CI, it destroys the lane's
  reason to exist, and it is redundant once `rust workspace` compiles and runs those targets
  pre-merge.
- **Platform failures have been Windows-specific**: a `python` executable absent from `PATH`, and
  `core.autocrlf` turning `depth = 2` into `depth = 2\r`. No macOS-specific failure has occurred.
- **Windows is the slowest job in the gate** (≈17 min, against ≈12 min for the Linux workspace on a
  warm cache and ≈18 min cold), so deferring the matrix is what buys the merge throughput this
  design is for.

The cost is stated plainly: a pull request into `main` now waits for `rust workspace`, measured at
18m17s on a cold cache and around twelve minutes warm, rather than forty seconds. Because a branch
that falls behind `main` must re-run its checks, a serial chain of rebases pays that repeatedly. Two
mitigations already exist and are worth using before the cost is treated as inherent: independent
changes can share one pull request with one commit per topic, and `merge-readiness.yml` already
handles `merge_group`, so a merge queue can validate several candidates as one batch once `ci.yml`
gains the same trigger.

## Merge readiness contract

`.github/workflows/merge-readiness.yml` runs for `pull_request` and `merge_group` events targeting
`main`. It is now the **fail-fast lane**: its slowest measured contract lane is 33s and the aggregator
4s, so obvious breakage is reported in well under a minute rather than after the Linux workspace job.
Keeping it that fast is the reason `--all-targets` was reverted below. It is no longer the only
pre-merge evidence, and it was never sufficient on its own. The aggregator fails unless all of these
independent lanes succeed:

1. `cargo check --workspace --exclude fsl-solver-z3 --exclude fslc-rust --no-default-features
   --locked` catches compile and dependency-integration drift across the authoritative
   native-Z3-free Rust surface without paying the vendored native-Z3 build cost before merge.
   Excluding the native CLI package as a workspace root avoids its Z3-only helper binaries; its
   library still compiles transitively through the LSP and WASM crates. **`--all-targets` is
   deliberately absent**: it was added, measured at 12m42s, and reverted, because this lane's whole
   value is sub-minute feedback and `rust workspace` already compiles and runs those targets on the
   same pull request.
2. Formatting, the `fsl-syntax`, `fsl-core`, `fsl-runtime`, and backend-neutral `fsl-solver` tests,
   plus the runtime/WASM dependency negative controls, protect the solver-independent semantic
   foundation.
3. The automation contract lane protects post-merge failure creation, duplicate suppression,
   recurrence updates, recovery closure, and workflow-level failure handling. It also runs the
   checked-in Codex/Claude task-harness contracts with the system Python: a discovered soundness
   finding must remain in the worktree ledger until fixed, linked to an issue, or explicitly marked
   as awaiting issue-creation authorization.

The lanes run in parallel through `tools/check-merge-readiness.sh`. Native-CLI/default-feature
compilation, all-target compilation, Clippy, native Z3 verification, the complete LSP/corpus suites,
the full workspace test/build, JavaScript solver probes, and browser Worker validation remain
product-gate evidence. A green readiness check must never be rendered or documented as a fully
verified product.

Superseded runs for the same pull request are cancelled. Merge-group runs are not cancelled and the
workflow handles GitHub's `merge_group` event directly, so a merge queue can validate the combined
candidate against current `main`.

## Product gate contract

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is named `product gate`. A trusted `main` push runs all of these jobs in
parallel:

- the complete Rust-native integration phase from `tools/check-native-integration.sh rust`
  (`rust workspace`);
- the production WASM/browser phase from `tools/check-native-integration.sh wasm` (`WASM`);
- focused native-Z3 tests on macOS and Windows (`native Z3 4.16`);
- the M13 semantic mutation gate from `tools/check-native-integration.sh semantic-mutation`
  (`semantic mutation`), including curated implementation operators and pinned generic mutants.
- the deterministic finite-model agreement gate from `tools/check-native-integration.sh fsl-logic`
  (`FSL Logic Test`).

**The first two carry no event condition and therefore also run on every pull request**, which is
what makes the Linux evidence pre-merge. Only `native Z3 4.16` and the aggregate `product gate`
context honour `FSL_OPTIMISTIC_CI` and skip on pull requests into `main`.

`semantic mutation` is required on pull requests and every product-gate event. Ordinary pull
requests run all curated controls plus generic mutants intersecting the recorded base-to-head diff;
pushes, schedules, manual runs, and pull requests targeting `production` run the complete accepted
P2 pilot. The runner is pinned and
its raw machine-readable outcomes are retained as an artifact. A survivor, timeout, stale operator,
missing output, or incomplete job fails the lane; the aggregate gate never treats it as a deliberate
skip. [`DESIGN-semantic-mutation-gate.md`](DESIGN-semantic-mutation-gate.md) owns the detailed scope
and classification contract.

`FSL Logic Test` is likewise required everywhere. Ordinary pull requests run the bounded `pr` case
budget; other product events, including pull requests targeting `production`, run the larger
3-seed/3-depth `scheduled` matrix. Its artifact begins incomplete and is valid
only when expected, executed, and recorded case counts agree and every named semantic edge ran. A
missing or truncated report therefore cannot be mistaken for agreement. The detailed generation,
lineage, replay, shrink, and exclusion contract is in
[`DESIGN-fsl-logic-test.md`](DESIGN-fsl-logic-test.md).

Scheduled and manual runs use the same evidence. Pull requests into `production` also run the
complete product gate and emit the Linux native-Z3 compatibility context expected by the production
ruleset. Release jobs retain their independent four-target build, smoke, ABI, LSP, and packaging
checks. An always-running `product gate` aggregator fails unless every required lane emitted
successful evidence; an accidentally skipped lane cannot make the workflow confidently green.

Product-gate runs for merged commits are not cancelled. Each merged state therefore retains its own
portable evidence and failure attribution even when agents merge changes quickly.

## Failure reporting contract

`.github/workflows/post-merge-ci-reporter.yml` listens for completed `product gate` runs. It acts
only when the triggering run was a push to the repository's default branch. The workflow receives
read access to Actions, contents, and pull requests, and write access only to issues.

For each failed, timed-out, cancelled, stale, startup-failed, or action-required job, the reporter:

- creates the `ci/post-merge` label when necessary;
- creates one canonical issue keyed by the product-gate workflow ID and stable job name, reopening
  the same issue after a later recurrence;
- records the commit, associated merged pull request, run, job, conclusion, and failed step names;
- copies no build log text or secret-bearing output into the issue;
- adds one occurrence comment for a later failing run instead of opening a duplicate;
- closes the matching issue only after that job, or the complete product gate, succeeds on a later
  `main` run.

An unsuccessful workflow with no failed-job metadata gets a workflow-level issue, so startup and
orchestration failures do not disappear. Re-running the reporter for the same product-gate run is
idempotent. Before mutating issues, the reporter queries the latest completed trusted push run for
the same workflow. When an older `run_number`/`run_attempt` event arrives, it reconciles that latest
run instead of the stale trigger; out-of-order platform completion cannot overwrite newer
default-branch health or cancel the only reporter for a persistent newer failure.

Reporter jobs are also serialized to avoid duplicate-creation races. When product gates finish
faster than reporting, GitHub may coalesce pending reporter runs toward the newest default-branch
health state; the underlying product-gate result remains attached to every merged commit, and any
failure that persists at the current `main` head remains an open issue.
When a concrete lane and the aggregate `product gate` job fail together, only the concrete lane is
reported; the aggregate is reported on its own only when it is the sole available failure.

## Safe rollout and rollback

The workflow change must land before the ruleset changes; otherwise existing pull requests cannot
produce the new required context. Roll out in this order:

1. Merge the workflow change. `rust workspace` and `WASM` begin running on pull requests
   immediately, as visible but not-yet-required evidence.
2. In the `main` repository ruleset, add `rust workspace` and `WASM` alongside `merge readiness`.
   `native Z3 4.16 (macos-15)` and `native Z3 4.16 (windows-latest)` stay out of the required set —
   they are the deferred cross-platform matrix.
3. Leave `FSL_OPTIMISTIC_CI=enabled`. It now governs only the cross-platform matrix and the
   aggregate `product gate` context; main pushes, schedules, manual runs, and production promotions
   ignore it as before.

Rollback is fail-safe and has two independent levers. To return the Linux evidence to post-merge,
restore the `if:` conditions on `rust workspace` and `WASM` and drop them from the ruleset. To return
to a fully pre-merge gate, delete or change `FSL_OPTIMISTIC_CI` and restore all four product contexts
in the main ruleset. No source or product artifact migration is involved either way.

### Why the ruleset step is not optional

A job that runs on a pull request but is not a required context is *advisory*: it can fail while the
merge still succeeds. Until step 2 lands, this change buys visibility, not enforcement — and the
gap it exists to close is precisely one that a disciplined developer already covers by running
`./tools/check-native-integration.sh` locally. The point of the change is to stop depending on that
discipline, which step 1 alone does not achieve.

## Non-goals

- Treating issue creation as a substitute for repair, revert, or release blocking.
- Hiding platform failures with `continue-on-error`.
- Trusting agent-authored verification claims in place of independent GitHub-hosted execution.
- Changing FSL language, Kernel, CLI/JSON, LSP, Worker, or frozen Python compatibility behavior.
